This C++ program implements a producer-consumer model with asynchronous processing and post-processing of tasks. The program involves multiple threads: one producer thread and four consumer threads, each handling different types of tasks. The producer generates tasks and places them in a shared queue, while the consumers process the tasks and perform specific post-processing based on the task type.
